## About This Project

The primary goal of this project is to learn the Go programming language by porting an existing C# application, **[RectanglesCalculator](https://github.com/jahanalem/RectanglesCalculator)**.

A secondary goal is to compare the performance of the Go implementation against the highly optimized C# version for this specific CPU-bound, parallel processing task.

> **Note**: This project is currently a work in progress.
